# Telematics

**Telematics** is a Flutter-based application designed to connect with an ESP32 device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The ESP32 serves as a gateway to interact with an MCU500 sensor, capturing real-time data. This app collects and processes the sensor data, presenting it in the form of interactive sessions for users.

## Key Features

* **Seamless BLE Connectivity**: Establishes a robust connection with the ESP32 device to ensure reliable data transmission.
* **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Receives data from the connected MPU6050 sensor and displays it within the app.
* **Session-based Visualization**: Organizes and presents sensor data into user-friendly sessions for easier interpretation.
* **User-friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity and usability in mind, providing an intuitive experience for both technical and non-technical users.

## Getting Started

This project is an ideal starting point for developers aiming to build applications for IoT-based solutions using Flutter. The code is structured to be easily extendable for additional features like advanced analytics, notifications, or cloud integration.
